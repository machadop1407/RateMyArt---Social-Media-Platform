# RateMyArt---Social-Media-Platform
This is a social media platform targeted for artists and architects to post their work. Each user can create an account or log in to an existent one. After being signed it, they can view every art work posted. The algorithm used to display the works takes into account the time in which the upload was posted and a combination of likes plus comments it received. This allows users to grow organically through the website. Users can also follow other users and see their own following feed, which only displays posts from their followers. This project also includes the use of password hashing and authentication by using sessions. The input fields are also protected against attacks, specially SQL injections.
